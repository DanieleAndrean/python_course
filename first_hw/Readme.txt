Run the main.py file to test the program.

The user is asked to create the trainer and select the first Pokemon.

Moves are added to that Pokemon to test the control on the maximum moves number. NB due to the small number of moves available, 
duplicate moves are allowed.

Pokemons are added to the trainer to test the case in which the maximum nuber of pokemons is reached.

A simple combat with a wild pokemon is simulated. Only the first selected Pokemon is available for the user, all the other Pokemons are set to KO.
